# 3D MODELS FOR CASE DESIGN

Included in this repo are .Step files created in Solidworks which were used to make the improved cases for the 16 chn and the 32 Chn KHU systems. All cases are made from plastic and all fixes are also insulating, so no metal parts are touchable

### 32 Chn Case

This case was cut out using a CNC machine from 4.5 mm ABS. The 4 inner pieces were glued together using acetone, with bracing pieces running along the inside edge. Drawings for CNC machine for both 32 system and power supply case found in Docs/Case_drawings ``32-CNC-Assembly.pdf``

### Power Supply Case

Constructued using similar methods to system case, with all but the lid stuck togther with bracing. To screw the lid on, corner pieces ``32PowerCaseCNR`` were 3D printed and an plastic nut added. These were then glued in all four corners with epoxy

### 16 Case
This was laser cut out of 4mm perspex - power supply could just about squeeze in the back. File used for laser cutting was ``16-Laser-assembly.pdf``

### Fans

In all cases the fans used were San Ace 120 model num ``9S1212M4001`` from farnell. These run at 12 V, so another XP Power AC/DC converter was added to the power supply case, with a separate connection to the system case
