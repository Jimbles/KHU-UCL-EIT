# KHU MATLAB SOFTWARE

Software used in UCL group for making life a bit easier using the KHU Mk2.5 EIT system

## Load_data

`khu_load.m` converts the data in a subdirectory into mV, as well as the protocol and other system settings. This is standalone, but can reference the .mat file made in `khu_makepairwise.m`

## Make_script

Most important script is `khu_makepairwise.m`, which creates the required script and proj file for the desired protocol/current/gain etc. 

## Calibration

These scripts load the calibration data located in the various .txt files generated by the KHU C++ GUI, and tries to apply some of the fuzzy logic/received wisdom from Bishal and other users
